Trump is preparing to build the wall. [Zero Hedge](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-01-03/trump-tells-dhs-prep-border-wall-construction-demands-info-all-immigration-related-e) and Reuters report that his administration asked the DHS for an assessment of "all assets available for border wall and barrier construction."

The report also discusses other border enforcement measures, such as aerial surveillance and more jail space for captured illegals. 

Of Trump's many campaign promises, [Trumpian conservatives](http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2016-11-09.html) are most insistent about him keeping the promise to #BuildTheWall. It also happens to be low on the list of promises progressive agitators are insistent on him breaking. (They are more concerned, for example, that he not deport 11 million illegals or banning immigration from terrorism-soaked countries.) So perhaps there is a compromise here.
