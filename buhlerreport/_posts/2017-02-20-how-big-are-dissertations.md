My [philosophy dissertation](/phd) was about 200 pages. 

Everyone knows that each discipline has different standards. History dissertations tend to be longer, and science dissertations tend to be shorter. 

The question is, how different? 

[Beck has done some of the grunt work to gather and analyze the data. (Appropriately enough, he did so while procrastinating on his dissertation.)](https://beckmw.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/how-long-is-the-average-dissertation/) 

For example, history (275-300), anthropology (200-300), and political science (200-275) have the highest averages. Biostatics (90-120), mathematics (75-125), and economics (75-120) have the shortest averages. 

The vast majority, as is to be expected, were between 100-200 pages. The mean was 177, median 161, with a standard deviation of 90.
