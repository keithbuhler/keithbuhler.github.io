I am a California-based entrepreneur and educator. 

In the business space, I founded [Numinor](https://www.numinorhomes.com/), an investment focused on thoughtful property acquisition and development. 

Drawing on robust strategic planning, we bring a long-view perspective to real estate — one rooted in vision and value creation. We identifies undervalued properties and transform them into profitable assets for the short or long-term. 

In the education space, I am the founding headmaster of [St Andrew Academy](https://www.saintandrewacademy.com/), where I teach and currently serves as Director of Advancement. I am adjunct professor in the Honors College at Azusa Pacific University, and a west coast [Fellow of the Alcuin Fellowship.](https://alcuinfellowship.com/)


Whether navigating the complexities of a flip or leading a classroom discussion on Plato, I appliy the same core principles: clarity, discipline, and maximizing the good.

I'm not only passionate about fundraising for small Christian schools. I like to help teachers fund their own side hustle through real estate, and help donors to leverage their donations to support schools for the long-run. 

The bottom line is this: Every human being needs to pursue virtue. And it's better to start as children. To become wise in this crazy world requires wise teachers: first, parents, then mentors. 

A life of prayer, wisdom, and other-worldly joy is possible. 

It starts with classical, Christian education. Christian homes with marriages intact. Parishes and schools that are humble and unified. People falling in love with beauty. Having fun with logical thinking. Extreme devotion to moderation.  Life-long learning. 

Living well is a skill. Happiness is a skill. It's an activity we can get better at. As adults, we lead the way for our children. 


Thanks for visiting, let me know how I can help you.
