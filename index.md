I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Kentucky and a philosophy instructor at Asbury University. 

My research puts an Aristotelian form of virtue ethics in conversation with contemporary ethical and metaphysical naturalism. For example, I'm especially interested in critiques of modern moral philosophy and the attempt to provide a scientifically respectable articulation of the age-old view that virtue is 'natural.'  More broadly, I have a long-standing interest in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind, Plato, and philosophy of religion. 

I completed my PhD in philosophy under the direction of David Bradshaw. I also hold a master's degree in Orthodox Theology from the University of Balamand and a bachelor's in Humanities from Biola University.

My research centers on naturalism and its rivals. I am developing a novel form of ethical naturalism that builds on Philippa Foot and Michael Thompson's concept of natural norms. My [dissertation](/phd), titled "Becoming What We Are", defends Philippa Foot's ethical naturalism and criticizes that of John McDowell, whose conception of 'nature' I argue is contradictory. Virtue and especially practical wisdom are *natural*  for human beings (in a sense that I explain in detail). My future work puts Foot's "secular natural law theory" into conversation with religious theorists such as Mark Murphy, John Finnis, and Tristram Englehardt.

Over the last 15 years, I've helped almost a thousand students of all ages to learn and grow.
