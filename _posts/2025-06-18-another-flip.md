Another successful flip! thanks to the team Mark Collinsworth (Bluegrass Service) and Ciara Hagedorn (ReMax)

This was a fun one. 

The owner needed to get out quick -- so the buy price was good. But it didn't need much work! Just some paint and a HVAC upgrade. 

Then it was back on the market within 42 days. 

It became an *affordable* townhome for the perfect first-time homebuyer: a single gal, first generation American, and professional working in Lexington. 

I love this process of snagging projects that a first time homebuyer couldn't pull off by herself -- and delivering to her a home. On to the next one!
