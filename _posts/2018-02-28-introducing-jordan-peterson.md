If you're just hearing about JBP, don't let anyone define him into a box for you, too quickly. Get to know him.

His critics like to use their one (and only?) trusty tool of slander and guilt-by-association. 

In reality, Peterson is a clinical and academic psychologist. He has spent years in clinical practice and published widely influential research on religion, mythology, and psychology. 

More recently (as in 2-3 years ago), he became YouTube content creator and political commentator. 

I've been enjoying Peterson's YouTube content for a while now. There's a lot of it, far more than I have seen. He's more than just a pundit on sexual politics. For example, [he explains why your path to enlightenment goes down through the darkest parts of you, the places you least want to see, acknowledge, and tackle.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fesSvXKxYd0&feature=youtu.be)
