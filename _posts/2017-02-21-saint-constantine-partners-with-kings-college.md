John Mark Reynolds, the founder of the Torrey Honors Institute (my alma mater), started a new school: [the Saint Constantine School](http://www.saintconstantine.org/). 

Rather than start small, Saint Constantine has partnered for college credit with the one of a kind [King's College in New York.](https://www.tkc.edu/stories/kings-announces-partnership-saint-constantine-school/) It will eventually serve K-College. 

These are exciting times for classical education. And especially if you live in or near Sugar Land, Texas, [check out the school.](http://www.saintconstantine.org/)
