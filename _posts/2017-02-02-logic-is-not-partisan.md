>“To me it appears blasphemous to say God is 'above’ logic. Logic is not partisan, and knows nothing but to strike straight; but the sword is invincible, bearing the Maker’s name.” --Peter Geach

From a nice [Telegraph obituary at the time of his death in 2014.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10572088/Peter-Geach-obituary.html)
