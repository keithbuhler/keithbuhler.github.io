The interview between Jordan Peterson and Cathy Newman of Channel 4 is a must see.   

If you have 30 minutes to spare... the video will edify and/or decimate you.

Awesome. 

<br> 
 
Among my favorite highlights from this interview are the underrated lines: 

- "Grow the hell up." 
- "Women deeply want men who are competent." 

<br> 

In my view, Newman tussled with a well-researched, well-spoken psychologist who actually knows people from his decades in clinical psychology. She wasn't prepared for calm, well-reasoned answers delivered in a friendly manner. 

She looked like she was piling up straw men. She helped increase his fame.


## The Reactions

Lately, Peterson's "book tour" consists of simply going on television, saying true things simply and forcefully, receiving insane backlash, and creating internet culture. 

There have been serious and not-so-serious reactions.
