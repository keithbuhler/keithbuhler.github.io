There was a big fight tonight... Congratulations are in order to Ukraine and to its champion boxer

It was a beautiful fight. English has its Alexander Pope, tennis has its Roger Federer, boxing has its Vasyl Lomachenko. 

[I wrote about this Orthodox Christian boxer back in September of 2017.]((http://www.keithbuhler.com/culture/2017/09/14/lomachenko.html) 

He is a musician as much as a boxer. Rhythm, rhyme, repetition, syncopation. It's beautiful to watch. 

On May 11, I mentioned that the fight was coming up and predicted that "take down his next opponent and become a three-weight-class world champion. His fighting style is, as of now, unstoppable." Although Lomachenko got knocked down in the sixth round he showed class by thanking Linares for teaching him a lesson. 

He also showed his humility by giving credit to his father and trainer saying, "My father told me to go for the body in the final rounds, so I did."
