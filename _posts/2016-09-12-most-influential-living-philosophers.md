People sometimes ask me "are there any philosophers alive today?" On the one hand, I totally get it. They are asking whether there is a modern day Plato or Socrates or Aquinas. On the other hand, after studying philosophy the last 6 years, this sounds to me like asking, "are any phycisists alive today or was Newton it?" 

The answer is there are thousands of philosophers alive today. Will any of them be the next John Locke or David Hume? The answer is probably Yes, we just don't know exactly whose influence will last the next 2000 years. But [here's a good start.](http://www.thebestschools.org/features/most-influential-living-philosophers/)

The Best Schools.org has compiled a list of 50 most influential philosophers alive today. They say: 

>Contemporary philosophers are enormously influential right now. Take Princeton’s Peter Singer and his work on animal ethics. How society sees its responsibilities to nonhuman others owes much to Singer. Though usually not household names, contemporary philosophers have radically altered the way we think about all sorts of things — from the nature of God to the role of race in democracy.

Take a look at what 50 great philosophers are up to... Who will survive the sands of time? Only time will tell.

I would add Alvin Plantinga and Richard Swinburne to the list -- but it's a pretty good list.
