[David Litwa provides a fascinating (and to my mind accurate) survey of deification.](https://www.academia.edu/30578073/Becoming_Gods_Deification_and_the_Supernatural) 

His article clarifies what the notion of "becoming god" amounts to, and explains the various species of deifiction: political deification, deification through beauty, deification as magic, deification as imitation, Christian deification, self-deification, deification through Gnosticism. This is all historically informative and very interesting; the kicker is that he accurately covers our own fashionable form of deification: [techno-deification.](http://www.keithbuhler.com/buhlerreport/singularity-chalmers) 

Litwa's article is a fascinating peek into human nature and will ~~instantly transform you into a god~~ illuminate you.
