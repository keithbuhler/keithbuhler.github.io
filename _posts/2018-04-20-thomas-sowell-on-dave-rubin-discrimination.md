This interview is edifying, informative, and challenging on multiple levels. 

Dave Rubin talks with Thomas Sowell about his life, his education, and his new book on three different kinds of discrimination. 

It includes a beautiful story that Sowell relates about how a young boy took him to a public library and taught him that you can read books even if you don't buy them. That young boy gave us one of the world's great living scholars.
