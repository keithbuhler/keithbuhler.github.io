# Time Budget #

How do you manage your time? 

When you stop to think about it, there are only (24*7=)168 hours in a week. If you sleep 8 hours a night or so that's (8*7=)56 sleeping hours for a total of (168-56=)112 waking hours per week.

What do you do with those 112 hours? The difference between King Tut and last year's Darwin Award winner is how they spend that 112 hours.

## 112 Hours

If you have a job, you probably work about 40 hours a week. You might work 20 - 80 hours, but 40 is a nice round average we can work with. Supposing you work 40 hours a week, you still have (112-40=)72 hours per week to play with. Family, school, church, hobbies, sports, TV, Facebook, napping, shopping, commuting, cooking, traveling, washing dishes, and perhaps downtime occupies 72 hours; almost *double* a work week at a full time job. 


The [168 Hour Time Budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YxJ6wGGUk96KHh-Q_G-1POAyTQsckzl6fy_87ag7v58/edit) is all about taking control of that time.
