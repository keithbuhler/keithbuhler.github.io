I have a neat system for organizing papers on my desk which demand attention. There are approximately eleven categories. 

1. Need to grade 
2. Begun grading, need to finish 
3. Completely graded, need to input grades in gradebook 
4. Graded all multiple choice, need to grade essays
5. Lost cover sheet, need to find out who paper/test belongs to 
7. Graded, inputted, and ready to return
8. Graded, inputted, but has fresh coffee stains; allow to dry, then return
9. Crinkled beyond recognition by infant daughter; request electronic version
10. Electronic version sent, but lost in the catacombs of "Downloads" folder; request second copy
11. Don't want to grade; postponing as long a possible
