### **Some big picture points**


**Memorize this**


| Act           | Result      | Virtue | 
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Apprehension  |     Term    | Clear | 
| Judgment      | Sentence    | True  |
| Reasoning     | Argument    | Valid |




</section><section data-markdown>

### 3 Acts of the Mind

1st act: Simple apprehension

2nd act: Judgment

3rd act: Reasoning


- Arguing, Proving, Demonstrating
- Surmising, Guessing
- Generalizing
- Result = Arguments
- Good arguments = Valid






</section><section data-markdown>

### **Some Big picture points**

1. Logic is inevitable and useful
2. Premise and conclusion
3. 3 acts of the mind: conceiving, judging, reasoning
4. 3 laws of thought are necessary truths, identity, non-contradiction
5. To evaluate an argument, search for the conclusion first
6. Then examine the clarity of the terms, the truth of the premises, and the validity of the inference











</section><section data-markdown>

**Conclusions** 

The conclusion is the truth claim. (For example: “Trump is the 47th president” can be a conclusion.) Premises are statements that, if true, support or prove your conclusion. (For example, statements that support the claim above might be: Trump won the presidential election” and “there were 46 U.S. Presidents before 2024.”)










</section><section data-markdown>

**Conclusions**

The conclusion is the whole point of the argument. Always ask yourself, “What am I being asked to believe?” That is the conclusion of the argument. Everything else is a premise (or irrelevent). 














</section><section data-markdown>


**Three "3"s** 

* 3 Acts of the mind
* 3 Products: Terms, judgments, arguments
* 3 Laws







</section><section data-markdown>


### Three Laws

Some truths are self-evident foundations of thinking. For example, the classical “laws of thought”:

1. Every thing is identical to itself (A=A)
2. No thing can be A and not A at the same time in the same respect. (X cannot be A and not-A)
3. Every affirmation is either true or false. (A=true or A=false)

</section><section data-markdown>


### Three Laws

These laws are *necessary truths*. 


Some truths are necessary -- they have to be true and can be known with certainty.

>There's actually a whole scale of 'modality')
> 1. Impossible
> 2. Contingent but false
> 3. Contingent and true
> 4. Necessarily true


</section><section data-markdown>


**In a word...**

>Logic is the science of arguments. An argument is a proof composed of premises (that support the conclusion) and a conclusion. Arguments are composed of words. Good arguments have clearly defined words, true premises, and a valid inference to the conclusion. Fallacies are bad arguments. A good argument *necessarily* entails the conclusion; a good argument is the most scientific form of rational proof.

* **Discussion** 

* Reactions so far? Questions? 
* Thoughts? 
* Break 








</section><section data-markdown>

**Euthyphro**

* Let's read a bit of Plato to show the importance of logic in thinking about God

[Link to Euthyphro](https://classics.mit.edu/Plato/euthyfro.html)






















</section><section data-markdown>

**What is Euthyphro's claim #1**

* Holiness (piety, righteousness) is 'whatever is loved by the gods'
* Problem #1: the gods disagree


</section><section data-markdown>


** Claim #2** 

* Holiness (piety, righteousness) is 'whatever is loved by *all* the gods'
* Problem #2: which way does the arrow of causation go? 


* Do the gods recognize holiness and love it? (example, calling the car red)
* Do the gods love a thing and it becomes holy? (example, painting my car my favorite color)

**Example 5**

>"It is obvious to anyone thinking logically that minimum wage should be increased. The current minimum wage is an insult and is unfair to the people who receive it. The fact that the last proposed minimum wage increase was denied is proof that the government of this state is crooked and corrupt. The only way for them to prove otherwise is to raise minimum wage immediately.""


- What is the conclusion? 
- Valid inference? true premises? clear terms?

# Day 2 - Acts of the Mind

---


**Intro to Logic, St Athanasius College, 2025**


---




* First act of the mind: understanding
* Second act: judgment
* (Approx 28 slides + Euthyphro)

</section>

<section data-markdown>

### 1st act of the mind: Simple Apprehension

- Conception
- Naming
- Identifying
- Cognizing & recognizing
- Result = Terms
- Good terms = *clear*




</section><section data-markdown>



### What makes man different from machine? (or animal)

* Gods, men, and brutes
* Gods don't question (they already know)
* Brutes don't question (they don't realize they don't know anything)
* Machines don't question (they have to be programmed)
* *Men question (they know they don't know)* 
* The Aristotle story (35)






</section><section data-markdown>


### Questions and Concepts

* Our questions are: What, whather, why? 
* The answers to these questions require concepts, the "bits" or raw material of thought
* Concepts are immaterial (trascend time and space!) 
* Concepts 'match' reality, they illuminate reality
* Concepts are abstract (separate 'green' from the 'grass') -- separate the squareness from this or that square shape
	* Abstraction foster friendship (38)!
* Concepts are universal (tree vs. that tree; dog vs Fido)
* Relations between concepts are necessary. (Triangles necessarily have three sides)
* Concepts are unchanging 












</section><section data-markdown>


### Concepts, terms and words

* Concept is in the mind
* A term is in the public domain -- a term is a concept in expression (transcends language though)
* A word is a linguistic expression of a term (any language will do!) 
* The term 'love' is referred to by 'amore' 'caritas' 'amor' 'lieb' (six *words*, one term)
* A term is the most basic unit of meaning
* Terms are not true or false, but clear or unclear

</section><section data-markdown>





### 2nd Act of the Mind: Judgment (139-156)

- Proposition
- Declarative statements
- Relating two concepts
- Result = Sentences
- Good judgments = *true*




</section><section data-markdown>

## **Subject and predicate**


* Subject is what we are talking about 
* Predicate is what we are saying about the subject
* We are "predicating" an action or adjective "of" the subject
* Order matters: 2+2=4 is the same as 4=2+2, but "god is Love" is not the same as "love is god"!
*  S is P. Subject is predicate. S is my sermon subject, P is my sermon. S is my title, P is my essay. 


























</section><section data-markdown>

## Judgment (thought), proposition (language), sentence (writing) 

* Judgments are *expressed* in propositions
* Judgment is the act of the mind (can be inner, private) while propositions are expressed in language, math, symbols, etc. 
* Sentences are expressions of propositions: "Fear "


* Kinds of Propositions 
	* simple; 
	* complex; 
		* hypothetical, (if-then)
		* disjunctive, (or)
		* conjunctive (and)






</section><section data-markdown>

## **Non-declarative sentences**

* imperative, 
- interrogative, 
- exclamatory, 
- performative 
- (i.e., command, question, exclamation, and act)






</section><section data-markdown>


**Only propositions contain truth!**


* Words are neither true nor false
* Arguments (strictly speaking) are not true or false (only the conclusion is!)
* Truth resides in things too... 
	* true money (not counterfeit)
	* true Van Gogh (not a fake)
	* true piety (not false piety) 
	* true God (faithful, and trustworthy, and real)




</section><section data-markdown>

**Correspondance**


* Logical truth is the correspondance (of thought or word) to reality

>"To say of what is, that it is and to say of what is not, that it is not"




</section><section data-markdown>

**Four Kinds of Categorical Propositions**

Memorize this: 


| Letter        | Valence      | Scope 	|
|---------------|--------------|--------|
| A  			|  Positive  | Universal | 
| E 	        |  Negative    | Particular  |
| I 		    | Positive    | Universal |
| O 		    | Negative   | Particular |




</section><section data-markdown>

**Four Kinds of Categorical Propositions**

Memorize this: 


| Letter        | Example      | 
|---------------|--------------|
| A  			|  All men are mortal. 		|
| E 	        |  No men are winged 		|
| I 		    | Some men are blonde 		| 
| O 		    | Some men are not brunette | 


> A shortcut: nEgO (I negate, in Latin); and AffIrmo (I affirm, in Latin)







</section><section data-markdown>

### **Contradiction**


* There are multiple ways to be 'incompatible'!
* A and O *contradict* 
* E and I *contradict* 


* "All holy things are "set aside" for God." 
* As long as there is *thing that is both holy and not set aside*, we have a contradiction. 
* Finding contradictions is a wonderful means to discovering truth (dismantling false beliefs)








</section><section data-markdown>

## Exercises (157)


* Let's categorize some propositions!

1. Is it a proposition or not?
2. Is it A E I or O? 
3. What is the subject and what the predicate? 








</section><section data-markdown>

## **Distribution** (163) If we have time

* Distribution refers to the term, whether it refers to all members of the class (distributed)
* Or only some members of the class (undistributed)
* Analogy of distributing pamphlets





</section><section data-markdown>


# Day 2 - Review


* Conception is first act of mind; simply aprehending the essence of a thing
* Judgment is the second act of the mind; combining concepts (predication)
* Conception makes us higher than animals, and computers (including LLMs!), by abstraction
* Questions aim at truths, abstract truths
* Judgments are expressed in propositions; S is P (or S is not P), etc.
* Propositions can be simple or complex
* Propositions are true or false
* Propositions can be universal or particular, positive or negative (A E I O)

# Day 3 - Reasoning 


---


**Intro to Logic, St Athanasius College, 2025**


---


* Arguments: The core of logic
* Outline here! 



</section><section data-markdown>


### Argumentation (186-199)


* What is reason? 
* "man is a rational animal" 
	* The term 'man' is inclusive
	* 'rational' is inclusive too!
* 'Rationality' includes wisdom, intuition, essence, conscience, self-knowledge, aesthetics -- *and math* and logic





<section data-markdown>


### What can reason do? 

* Reason allows us to know what must be true, hypothetically (little green men on mars), beyond our experience
* Reason allows us to know universal truths (2 + 2)
* Reason allows us to know necessary and unchangable truths








</section><section data-markdown>

### Deduction


* Deduction is the ultimate foundation of the *syllogism*
* The syllogism is the 'atom' of reasonining, the building block of arguments, the cells of the rational organism

### Abduction (Explantions)

1. Buhler: Abduction (inference to best explanation) — CS. Pierce
    1. If A -> B, B, therefore A.
        1. The surprising fact, *C*, is observed.
        2. But if *A* were true, *C* would be a matter of course.
        3. Hence, there is reason to suspect that *A* is true.
    2. Inference to best explanation (Peter Lipton)
        1. Philosophy, psychology, economics, sociology, etc.
    3. “Guessing”
        1. Daily life
    4. Hypothesizing
        1. Science, philosophy, theology etc.
