### **Some big picture points**


**Memorize this**


| Act           | Result      | Virtue | 
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Apprehension  |     Term    | Clear | 
| Judgment      | Sentence    | True  |
| Reasoning     | Argument    | Valid |




</section><section data-markdown>

### 3 Acts of the Mind

1st act: Simple apprehension

2nd act: Judgment

3rd act: Reasoning


- Arguing, Proving, Demonstrating
- Surmising, Guessing
- Generalizing
- Result = Arguments
- Good arguments = Valid






</section><section data-markdown>

### **Some Big picture points**

1. Logic is inevitable and useful
2. Premise and conclusion
3. 3 acts of the mind: conceiving, judging, reasoning
4. 3 laws of thought are necessary truths, identity, non-contradiction
5. To evaluate an argument, search for the conclusion first
6. Then examine the clarity of the terms, the truth of the premises, and the validity of the inference











</section><section data-markdown>

**Conclusions** 

The conclusion is the truth claim. (For example: “Trump is the 47th president” can be a conclusion.) Premises are statements that, if true, support or prove your conclusion. (For example, statements that support the claim above might be: Trump won the presidential election” and “there were 46 U.S. Presidents before 2024.”)










</section><section data-markdown>

**Conclusions**

The conclusion is the whole point of the argument. Always ask yourself, “What am I being asked to believe?” That is the conclusion of the argument. Everything else is a premise (or irrelevent). 














</section><section data-markdown>


**Three "3"s** 

* 3 Acts of the mind
* 3 Products: Terms, judgments, arguments
* 3 Laws







</section><section data-markdown>


### Three Laws

Some truths are self-evident foundations of thinking. For example, the classical “laws of thought”:

1. Every thing is identical to itself (A=A)
2. No thing can be A and not A at the same time in the same respect. (X cannot be A and not-A)
3. Every affirmation is either true or false. (A=true or A=false)

</section><section data-markdown>

### Three Laws

* A rose is a rose. 
* The door cannot be both open and shut at the same time in the same respect. 
* The cat is on the mat -- is either true or false. It can't be neither.

</section><section data-markdown>


### Three Laws

These laws are *necessary truths*. 


Some truths are necessary -- they have to be true and can be known with certainty.

>There's actually a whole scale of 'modality')
> 1. Impossible
> 2. Contingent but false
> 3. Contingent and true
> 4. Necessarily true


</section><section data-markdown>


**In a word...**

>Logic is the science of arguments. An argument is a proof composed of premises (that support the conclusion) and a conclusion. Arguments are composed of words. Good arguments have clearly defined words, true premises, and a valid inference to the conclusion. Fallacies are bad arguments. A good argument *necessarily* entails the conclusion; a good argument is the most scientific form of rational proof.

* **Discussion** 

* Reactions so far? Questions? 
* Thoughts? 
* Break 








</section><section data-markdown>

**Euthyphro**

* Let's read a bit of Plato to show the importance of logic in thinking about God

[Link to Euthyphro](https://classics.mit.edu/Plato/euthyfro.html)






















</section><section data-markdown>

**What is Euthyphro's claim #1**

* Holiness (piety, righteousness) is 'whatever is loved by the gods'
* Problem #1: the gods disagree


</section><section data-markdown>


** Claim #2** 

* Holiness (piety, righteousness) is 'whatever is loved by *all* the gods'
* Problem #2: which way does the arrow of causation go? 


* Do the gods recognize holiness and love it? (example, calling the car red)
* Do the gods love a thing and it becomes holy? (example, painting my car my favorite color)

**Example 5**

>"It is obvious to anyone thinking logically that minimum wage should be increased. The current minimum wage is an insult and is unfair to the people who receive it. The fact that the last proposed minimum wage increase was denied is proof that the government of this state is crooked and corrupt. The only way for them to prove otherwise is to raise minimum wage immediately.""


- What is the conclusion? 
- Valid inference? true premises? clear terms?

# Day 2 - Acts of the Mind

---


**Intro to Logic, St Athanasius College, 2025**


---




* First act of the mind: understanding
* Second act: judgment
* Third act: reasoning
* (35 slides) 

</section>

<section data-markdown>

### 1st act of the mind: Simple Apprehension

- Conception
- Naming
- Identifying
- Cognizing & recognizing
- Result = Terms
- Good terms = *clear*




</section><section data-markdown>



### What makes man different from machine? (or animal)

* Gods, men, and brutes
* Gods don't question (they already know)
* Brutes don't question (they don't realize they don't know anything)
* Machines don't question (they have to be programmed)
* *Men question (they know they don't know)* 
* The Aristotle story (35)






</section><section data-markdown>


### Questions and Concepts

* Our questions are: What, whather, why? 
* The answers to these questions require concepts, the "bits" or raw material of thought
* Concepts are immaterial (trascend time and space!) 
* Concepts 'match' reality, they illuminate reality
* Concepts are abstract (separate 'green' from the 'grass') -- separate the squareness from this or that square shape
	* Abstraction foster friendship (38)!
* Concepts are universal (tree vs. that tree; dog vs Fido)
* Relations between concepts are necessary. (Triangles necessarily have three sides)
* Concepts are unchanging 












</section><section data-markdown>


### Concepts, terms and words

* Concept is in the mind
* A term is in the public domain -- a term is a concept in expression (transcends language though)
* A word is a linguistic expression of a term (any language will do!) 
* The term 'love' is referred to by 'amore' 'caritas' 'amor' 'lieb' (six *words*, one term)
* A term is the most basic unit of meaning
* Terms are not true or false, but clear or unclear (keep your money in the river bank)


</section><section data-markdown>

### Ambiguity

* Terms for *things* that are unclear are just 'unclear': mysterious, numinous, baffling
* Terms that could refer to either of two things are ambiguous: man (male or human?), bank (financial institution or river's edge?); 

> I saw her duck!


</section><section data-markdown>

### Ambiguity and speciality vocab

* "Tier 1" words: the, a, and, he, she  (8,000 words)
* "Tier 3" words: context, conduct, estate, invest, appreciate (570 words) 
* "Tier 2" words: isotope, lathe, peninsula, filibuster, (100,000s of words)

--- 

* Tier 1 words are hard to mess up. 
* Tier 2 words are extremely likely to become confused or confusing! Their exact meaning is sensitive to context. 
* Tier 3 words are extremely hard to mess up. However, they require specialized knowledge. 


</section><section data-markdown>

### Buhler's sidenote on speciality vocab

* The *clarity* of tier 3 words is a likely cause of technical jargon and specialized vocab that people develop and use --  doctors, philosophers, bankers, weight lifters, etc. 

> Give me 50 CCs on her IV, stat!

> The LTV on this DSCR is way too high after a refi, even with that ARV

> Neo-Platonic realism is ecclipsed by medieval nominalism

### Buhler's sidenote on speciality vocab

* Technicians and experts are not necessarily being a pedantic, snobby, or elitist by choiece -- it's the natural consequence of working within a domain. 

* </end sidenote>

### Extension and Intension of terms (43) 

* "Man = 4 billion men (males)
* "Man" = 8 billion men (mankind right now)
* "Man" = 50 billion men (mankind up to now)

  
* Inversely proportional -- the bigger the extension (number of referents), the smaller the intention (detail of description)

* Which has bigger extension?
	* Geese
	* Golden geese

</section><section data-markdown>

### Extension and Intension of terms 

* Qualitative aspects of a term:
* Comprehension, intention, connocation, meaning

* Quantitative aspects:
* Extension, denotation, reference

</section><section data-markdown>

### Comprehension (generalizations) and extension

* Comprehension covers what is true by nature
* Extension covers what is true by factual happenstance

* Comprehension (generalizations) can be true even with exceptions! (more on this later)

* St Peter is a rock (metaphor)
* God is a shepherd (metaphor)
* God is good (analogy)



  



</section><section data-markdown>

### Concrete & Abstract


* Concrete means specific (red, spirit)
* Abstract means 'taken out' (redness, spirituality)

* 'Hot' is concrete; 'heat' is abstract
* 'human' is concrete; 'humanity' is abstract

1. The end of a thing is its purpose and perfection, and death is the end of life; therefore death is life's purpose and perfection.
2. Condemned prisoner to judge: "But I don't *feel* guilty.*
3. Antigravity should be easy. We disobey all kinds of laws, we should be able to disobey the law of gravity.







</section><section data-markdown>

(If there's time) 

### Categories

* Natural and conventional
* Ten categories



</section><section data-markdown>

### Tree of Porphery (60) 

















</section><section data-markdown>



### 2nd Act of the Mind: Judgment (139-156)

- Proposition
- Declarative statements
- Relating two concepts
- Result = Sentences
- Good judgments = *true*




</section><section data-markdown>

## **Subject and predicate**


* Subject is what we are talking about 
* Predicate is what we are saying about the subject
* We are "predicating" an action or adjective "of" the subject
* Order matters: 2+2=4 is the same as 4=2+2, but "god is Love" is not the same as "love is god"!
*  S is P. Subject is predicate. S is my sermon subject, P is my sermon. S is my title, P is my essay. 


























</section><section data-markdown>

## Judgment (thought), proposition (language), sentence (writing) 

* Judgments are *expressed* in propositions
* Judgment is the act of the mind (can be inner, private) while propositions are expressed in language, math, symbols, etc. 
* Sentences are expressions of propositions: "Fear "


* Kinds of Propositions 
	* simple; 
	* complex; 
		* hypothetical, (if-then)
		* disjunctive, (or)
		* conjunctive (and)






</section><section data-markdown>

## **Non-declarative sentences**

* imperative, 
- interrogative, 
- exclamatory, 
- performative 
- (i.e., command, question, exclamation, and act)






</section><section data-markdown>


**Only propositions contain truth!**


* Words are neither true nor false
* Arguments (strictly speaking) are not true or false (only the conclusion is!)
* Truth resides in things too... 
	* true money (not counterfeit)
	* true Van Gogh (not a fake)
	* true piety (not false piety) 
	* true God (faithful, and trustworthy, and real)




</section><section data-markdown>

**Correspondance**


* Logical truth is the correspondance (of thought or word) to reality

>"To say of what is, that it is and to say of what is not, that it is not"




</section><section data-markdown>

**Four Kinds of Categorical Propositions**

Memorize this: 


| Letter        | Valence      | Scope 	|
|---------------|--------------|--------|
| A  			|  Positive  | Universal | 
| E 	        |  Negative    | Particular  |
| I 		    | Positive    | Universal |
| O 		    | Negative   | Particular |




</section><section data-markdown>

**Four Kinds of Categorical Propositions**

Memorize this: 


| Letter        | Example      | 
|---------------|--------------|
| A  			|  All men are mortal. 		|
| E 	        |  No men are winged 		|
| I 		    | Some men are blonde 		| 
| O 		    | Some men are not brunette | 


> A shortcut: nEgO (I negate, in Latin); and AffIrmo (I affirm, in Latin)







</section><section data-markdown>

### **Contradiction**


* There are multiple ways to be 'incompatible'!
* A and O *contradict* 

* "All holy things are "set aside" for God." 
* As long as there is *thing that is both holy and not set aside*, we have a contradiction. 

* Finding contradictions is a wonderful means to discovering truth (dismantling false beliefs)



</section><section data-markdown>

### **Contradiction**

* A and O *contradict* 
* E and I *contradict* 


No mammals lay eggs. 
Some mammals lay eggs. 


Ooops! You got [Platypused!](https://assets.wwf.org.au/image/upload/c_fill,g_auto,w_1400/f_auto/q_auto/v1/website-media/news-blogs/platypus_naturepicturelibrary?q=75)



</section><section data-markdown>

### **Contradiction**


* A and E *are contrary* though.


"All logic is useful. No logic is useful."  (Sounds like a contradiction but it's merely contrary.) 

* I and O *are compatible*. 

"A"

* A and I *are alterns*
* E and O *are alterns* 



</section><section data-markdown>

## Exercises (157)


* Let's categorize some propositions!

1. Is it a proposition or not?
2. Is it A E I or O? 
3. What is the subject and what the predicate? 








</section><section data-markdown>

## **Distribution** (163) If we have time

* Distribution refers to the term, whether it refers to all members of the class (distributed)
* Or only some members of the class (undistributed)
* Analogy of distributing pamphlets






</section><section data-markdown>


### Reasoning (Argumentation)  (186-199)


* What is reason? 
* "man is a rational animal" 
	* The term 'man' is inclusive
	* 'rational' is inclusive too!
* 'Rationality' includes wisdom, intuition, essence, conscience, self-knowledge, aesthetics -- *and math* and logic





</section><section data-markdown>


### What can reason do? 

* Reason allows us to know what must be true, hypothetically (little green men on mars), beyond our experience
* Reason allows us to know universal truths (2 + 2)
* Reason allows us to know necessary and unchangable truths








</section><section data-markdown>

### Deduction


* Deduction is the ultimate foundation of the *syllogism*
* The syllogism is the 'atom' of reasonining, the building block of arguments, the cells of the rational organism

> "All planets orbit the sun. Earth is a planet. Therefore...


















</section><section data-markdown>

### Tautology (189) 


* It is what it is
* A bird is a bird
* I am what I am
* Only the fittest survive
* You will pass if you work hard enough















</section><section data-markdown>
 
### Detecting arguments  (190) 


* Detect presence
* Get into our net
* Decide if edible

# Day 2 - Review


* Conception is first act of mind; simply aprehending the essence of a thing
* Judgment is the second act of the mind; combining concepts (predication)
* Conception makes us higher than animals, and computers (including LLMs!), by abstraction
* Questions aim at truths, abstract truths
* Judgments are expressed in propositions; S is P (or S is not P), etc.
* Propositions can be simple or complex
* Propositions are true or false
* Propositions can be universal or particular, positive or negative (A E I O)

# Day 3 - Fallacies  


---


**Intro to Logic, St Athanasius College, 2025**


---


* Induction, abduction
* Fallacies
* (48 slides!) 



</section><section data-markdown>

### **Induction, Deduction, Abduction**

- Induction: generalization
- Deduction: inference 
- Abduction: hypothesis

</section><section data-markdown>

### **Induction**

- Simple apprehension, plus induction is used to form basic propositions: 
- Grass is green, tables are hard, the sky is blue, Mom is kind, Fido is soft. 

> Every swan I have seen is white... And I've seen thousands! Therefore... 


</section><section data-markdown>

### **Induction**

Some different types of induction: 

> - Generalizations: the Chinese work hard at math
> - Statistics: 30% of Americans are overweight but not obese
> - Categorical statements: ducks lay eggs 
> - Generics: humans have 32 teeth

* Induction admits of exceptions! 
* Some Chinese don't work hard at math. 40% of Americans are obese; drakes do not lay eggs; and some people have lost teeth or genetically have extra teeth. 



</section><section data-markdown>

### **Generalizations**

* We tend to favor negative or dangerous generalizations: 

> Always wear repellent; mosquitos carry malaria

Only true of a tiny fraction of mosquitos... but because it's dangerous, it sticks in the mind. 

> I would never move there; that neighborhood has high crime.

LA has a violent crime rate of about 2% (i.e., maybe once a week)... 6 days of perfect peace, and yet it sticks in the mind!

* When it pays to err on the side of caution, we favor generalizations. 




</section><section data-markdown>

#### **Deduction**

* Deduction extends these basic propositions to the unknown. 
* If all dogs are mammals, and your pet is a dog, your dog is a mammal. 




</section><section data-markdown>

### Abduction (Explantions)

1. Buhler: Abduction (inference to best explanation) — CS. Pierce


* Structure of abduction (appears like a formal fallacy!)

* If A -> B, B, therefore A.
* The surprising fact, *B*, is observed.
* But if *A* were true, *B* would be a matter of course.
* Hence, there is reason to suspect that *A* is true.

</section><section data-markdown>


* Compare with Modus ponens: 
* If S is P, then Q is R.
* S is P.
* Therefore, Q is R. 

> * If Billy is a racist, then he would not celebrate Black Lives Matter day (July 13)
> * Billy is indeed a racist.
> * Therefore, Billy does not celebrate BLM day.  


</section><section data-markdown>


Here's a fallacy version: 

* If S is P, then Q is R.
* Q is R.
* Therefore, S is P. 

> * If John is a racist, then he would not celebrate Black Lives Matter day (July 13)
> * John does not celebrate BLM day. 
> * Therefore, perhaps John is a racist!


</section><section data-markdown>


### So what is abduction? Is it valid or not? 


Yes!

Abduction is guessing, hypothesizing, or explaining. 

- E.g., The ground is wet. If it was raining, the ground would be wet. So maybe it was raining. 
- Deductively invalid, but still important (Maybe sprinklers were on, or the fire hydrant is open, etc.)
- Perhaps the whole earth is round (it is). Maybe your mom is kind, too (she is). Perhaps all grass is green (it's not). Maybe all dogs are soft (they're not). 

</section><section data-markdown>


### Application of Abduction 

* Inference to best explanation (Peter Lipton) -- Philosophy, psychology, economics, sociology, etc.



</section><section data-markdown>


### Application of Abduction 

Educated “Guessing” in Daily life

* In daily life, we pull from background knowledge to explain what we observe. 

* Eg. Why is my door open? 
* Eg. Why is Anne acting so shifty lately? 
* Eg. Why is it getting darker earlier all of a sudden? 


</section><section data-markdown>


### Application of Abduction 

* Hypothesizing in specialized fields

* Science, philosophy, theology etc. employ domain-specific expertise to generate new guesses to be investigated
* Investigation cannot produce the guess! It can only analyze the guess once proposed. 


* Examples: 
	* Particle physics <!--Unfinished section--> -- maybe there is a thing that does not obey gravity
	* Philosophy -- maybe language formation (in humans) is like the construction of mathematical models (in computers)
	* Law -- maybe there were two assasins 
	* History -- maybe the pyramids were built with sound-wave technology 


</section><section data-markdown>


### Abduction





</section><section data-markdown>


### Informal fallacies (68-108) 

* Errors in reasoning not due to form
* Main sources: irrelevance, weak induction, presumption, ambiguity


</section><section data-markdown>


### Absurd examples of each 

* Irrelevance: "It's Thursday, therefore you owe me $20."  (Premise irrelevant to conclusion) 
* Presumption: "I know we disagree, but there's no point; you may as well concede; I've always been right in the past so you know I'm right in this case."
(Premise is a re-phrasing of the conclusion: you're wrong because you disagree with me)
* Weak induction:  "The mall is slow, therefore every shop is going to go out of business and the mall will soon close." (Premise relevant, but not connected enough)
* Ambiguity: "God is love. Love is blind. Ray Charles is blind. Ray Charles is God." ('Love' is a divine energy vs. 'love' is the human tendency to overlook faults.) 



</section><section data-markdown>


### Real life examples of each!


* Irrelevance: "We live in the age of the light bulb; we know that sickness is not due to angels or demons."  (Premise irrelevant to conclusion) 
* Presumption: "The Democratic [or Republican] party has no leadership; that's why they cannot build a strong coalition." (Premise is a re-phrasing of the conclusion: the group is not united because the group is not united)
* Weak induction:  "Birth rates have been dropping for over 10 years; in 50 years, the population of [Country X] will be zero." (Premise relevant, but not connected enough)
* Ambiguity: "Covid deaths have increased in 2024. Therefore, Covid is still dangerous." (Does 'covid death' mean people died and also had Covid or deaths *due to Covid*)

### Difference between formal and material

- Formal fallacies = your argument is invalid.
- Material fallacies = something else is wrong with your argument.

### So what are some themes / categories to help us understand these fallacies? 


</section><section data-markdown>

### Fallacies of Language

- **Equivocation**.  An equivocation trades upon the use of an ambiguous word or phrase in one of its meanings in one of the propositions of an argument but also in another of its meanings in a second proposition. Example: "Really exciting novels are rare. But rare books are expensive.Therefore, Really exciting novels are expensive."





</section><section data-markdown>

- **Amphiboly**. An amphiboly can occur even when every term in an argument is univocal, if the grammatical construction of a sentence creates its own ambiguity. Example: "A reckless motorist Thursday struck and injured a student who was jogging through the campus in his pickup truck. Therefore, it is unsafe to jog in your pickup truck."




</section><section data-markdown>


- **Spin/Slant**. Arguing by the positive or negative definitions or connotations of one's words.  
- Pro-choice vs. “Anti-choice”
- Pro-life vs. “Anti-Life”.
- "Terrorist" vs. "Freedom fighter". 
- "Radical" vs. "Pious" Believer. 
- "Rat" vs. "Whistle-blower"

### Fallacies of Relevance

1. **Ad Hominem.** (Attacking the person): This fallacy occurs when, instead of addressing someone's argument or position, you irrelevantly attack the person or some aspect of the person who is making the argument. The fallacious attack can also be direct to membership in a group or institution. Example: "Socrates' arguments about human excellence are rubbish. What could a man as ugly as he know about human excellence." "No, I will not reply. I see no need to defend my views against the objections of ignoramuses."




</section><section data-markdown>


2. **Appeal to Ignorance**. This fallacy occurs when you argue that your conclusion must be true, because there is no evidence against it. This fallacy wrongly shifts the burden of proof away from the one making the claim. Example: "You know that scientists can't prove that UFO's do not visit the Earth, so it makes sense to believe in them." "Since all who have tried to prove freedom of the will have failed, we are safe in assuming we are not free."




</section><section data-markdown>

3. **Appeal to (Irrelevant) Authority**. You appeal to authority if you back up your reasoning by saying that it is supported by what some authority says on the subject. Most reasoning of this kind is not fallacious, and much of our knowledge properly comes from listening to authorities. However, appealing to authority as a reason to believe something is fallacious whenever the authority appealed to is not really an authority in this particular subject, when the authority cannot be trusted to tell the truth, when authorities disagree on this subject (except for the occasional lone wolf), when the reasoner misquotes the authority, and so forth. Example:"The moon is covered with dust because the president of our neighborhood association said so." "Pacifism is a good idea because the brilliant scientist Einstein advocated it."




</section><section data-markdown>

- **Ad Populum (Appeal to the People, Appeal to Majority, Ad Numerum, Appeal to the Gallery, Appeal to the Masses, Argument from Popularity, Argumentum ad Populum, Common Practice, Mob Appeal, Past Practice, Peer Pressure, and Traditional Wisdom.)**. 




</section><section data-markdown>

- **Ad Populum**. This fallacy claims that the conclusion is correct simply because it's what most everyone believes. Agreement with popular opinion is not necessarily a reliable sign of truth, and deviation from popular opinion is not necessarily a reliable sign of error, but if you assume it is and do so with enthusiasm, then you are using this fallacy.  The "too strongly" mentioned above is important in the description of the fallacy because what most everyone believes is, for that reason, somewhat likely to be true, all things considered. However, the fallacy occurs when this degree of support is overestimated. Example: "You should turn to channel 6. It's the most watched channel this year."



</section><section data-markdown>

- **Appeal to Motive**. This fallacy assumes a motive behind the speaker arguing the conclusion, and then dismisses the conclusion as false. Examples: "You're only arguing that taxes should be abolished because you are an anarchist and hate the government." "You're just saying that education is important for children because you are a principal and you'd lose your job if we saw through the lies."




</section><section data-markdown>

- **Faulty Analogy**. This fallacy consists in assuming that because two things are alike in one or more respects, they are necessarily alike in some other respect. Examples: "Medical Student: "No one objects to a physician looking up a difficult case in medical books. Why, then, shouldn't students taking a difficult examination be permitted to use their textbooks?" "Because human bodies become less active as they grow older, and because they eventually die, it is reasonable to expect that political bodies will become less and less active the longer they are in existence, and that they too will eventually die."




</section><section data-markdown>

-  **Group think**. A reasoner uses the Group Think Fallacy if he or she substitutes pride of membership in the group for reasons to support the group's policy. If that's what our group thinks, then that's good enough for me. It's what I think, too. "Blind" patriotism is a rather nasty version of the fallacy. Example: "We K-Mart employees know that K-Mart brand items are better than Wall-Mart brand items because, well, they are from K-Mart, aren't they?"; "97% of scientists agree that human caused climate change is real."



</section><section data-markdown>

### Inductive Fallacies

- **Hasty generalization.** This fallacy occurs when we we make a generalization on the basis of insufficient evidence. This may occur when we rely on too small of a sample or an unrepresentative sample to support the generalization. Example: "Children of faculty are brats. I baby-sit for one of my professors and his children are spoiled and demanding."; "You don't want to take history from a man. They always have a sexist bias."

</section><section data-markdown>


- **Composition and Division.** This fallacy attributes properties of the parts to the whole or properties of the whole to the parts.  
- Examples of Composition: "Each person in America is a citizen, therefore the country is a citizen." "Each brick in the church is a rectangular. Therefore the dome of the church is rectangular." "The 9/11 bombers were Muslims therefore Islam is a violent religion."
- Examples of Division: "The Church as a whole is a spotless bride. Therefore I am a spotless bride." "The human race is thousands of years old. Therefore I am thousands of years old."

</section><section data-markdown>



- **Straw man**. Your reasoning contains the Straw Man Fallacy whenever you attribute an easily refuted position to your opponent, one that the opponent wouldn't endorse, and then proceed to attack the easily refuted position (the straw man) believing you have thereby undermined the opponent's actual position. Example: "Opponent: Because of the killing and suffering of Indians that followed Columbus's discovery of America, the City of Berkeley should declare that Columbus Day will no longer be observed in our city. Speaker: This is ridiculous, fellow members of the city council. It's not true that everybody who ever came to America from another country somehow oppressed the Indians. I say we should continue to observe Columbus Day, and vote down this resolution that will make the City of Berkeley the laughing stock of the nation."

</section><section data-markdown>

- **Non Sequitur**. When a conclusion is supported only by extremely weak reasons or by irrelevant reasons, the argument is fallacious and is said to be a Non Sequitur. However, we usually apply the term only when we cannot think of how to label the argument with a more specific fallacy name. Any deductively invalid inference is a non sequitur if it also very weak when assessed by inductive standards. Example: "Nuclear disarmament is a risk, but everything in life involves a risk. Every time you drive in a car you are taking a risk. If you're willing to drive in a car, you should be willing to have disarmament."

</section><section data-markdown>

- **Slippery Slope**. In a slippery slope argument, a course of action is rejected because, with little or no evidence, one insists that it will lead to a chain reaction resulting in an undesirable end or ends. The slippery slope involves an acceptance of a succession of events without direct evidence that this course of events will happen. Example: "We can't permit the sale of marijuana by doctor's prescription, because that will lead people to believe it's an acceptable drug; this will open the floodgates to the complete legalization of the drug for use by every pothead in the country."; "If Texas adopts a personal income tax, I'm moving away. An income tax at the state level is just a first step to communism."

</section><section data-markdown>

- **Post Hoc, Ergo Proper Hoc (False Cause)**. In the false cause argument, you cite event A as the cause of event B simply because B came after A. Example: "Every time I wear my green socks, we win the game." "The President's policies are so risky, the stock market bubble crashed as soon as he was elected."


</section><section data-markdown>


### Fallacies of Presumption
1. **Petitio Principii (Begging the Question).** The fallacy of begging the question occurs when an argument's premises assume the truth of the conclusion, instead of supporting it. In other words, you assume without proof the stand/position, or a significant part of the stand, that is in question. Begging the question is also called arguing in a circle. Example: "Erica: "How do you know that the bible is divinely inspired?" Pedro: "Because is says right in the third chapter of II Timothy that 'all scripture is given by divine inspiration of God.'; "People who deny the truth of Marxism are simply dancing to the tune of their capitalist masters, as Marx understood so well."

</section><section data-markdown>

2. **False Dilemma**. When you reason from an either-or position and you haven't considered all relevant possibilities you commit the fallacy of false dilemma. Examples: "Are you a Republican or a Democrat?" "Good students will study and learn without the threat of an exam, and bad students won't study and learn even with the threat of an exam. So, exams serve no purpose."

</section><section data-markdown>


3. **Loaded question**. Assuming something false as a premise of a question. Example: Prosecutor to defendant: "So how did you feel when you robbed the bank?" Reporter to politician: "When will you stop being a racist?"

</section><section data-markdown>

4. **Hedging**. You are hedging if you refine your claim simply to avoid counterevidence and then act as if your revised claim is the same as the original. Example: "Samantha: David is a totally selfish person. Yvonne: I thought we was a boy scout leader. Don’t you have to give a lot of your time for that? Samantha: Well, David’s totally selfish about what he gives money to. He won’t spend a dime on anyone else.  Yvonne: I saw him bidding on things at the high school auction fundraiser. Samantha: Well, except for that he’s totally selfish about money."

</section><section data-markdown>

5. **No True Scotsman**. This error is a kind of Ad Hoc Rescue of one's generalization in which the reasoner re-characterizes the situation solely in order to escape refutation of the generalization. Example: "Smith: All Scotsmen are loyal and brave. Jones: But McDougal over there is a Scotsman, and he was arrested by his commanding officer for running from the enemy.Smith: Well, if that's right, it just shows that McDougal wasn't a TRUE Scotsman."

### Metaphysical Fallacies

</section><section data-markdown>


### Nothing Buttery
- "A star is a big ball of burning gas" (no, a star is *made of* burning gas)
- I am reading "words words words" (no, you're reading *content*, *with* words)


</section><section data-markdown>


### Confusing Accident / Essence 
- adding race into definition of 'human person' 
- removing male-female parents from definition of  'family'
- "A great nose indicates a great man"
- "There is an incredible amount of empty space in the universe... And as to mass: the sun weighs about 2 followed by 27 noughts tons... it is not very easy to retain a belief in one's own cosmic importance in view of such overwhelming statistics."

</section><section data-markdown>

### Confusing Quality / Quantity

- Intelligence                = # IQ test score
- Beauty                      = # of dates
- Goodness of a Product       = # of people who buy it
- The number 7                = divine number       


</section><section data-markdown>

### Confusing Abstract / Concrete

- Abstract Beauty, Justice, etc. = Concrete forms
- Concrete Tom, Dick, Jane = Abstract "humanity"



</section><section data-markdown>

### Some Others


**Fallacies of Oversimplification**

> Jeremiah 11:29 says the Lord knows the plans he has for me, plans to prosper. Therefore every Christian can expect to be
prosperous in this life.

### Some Others

**Fallacies of Argumentation:**
> Contradictory premises: "Even if the fetus is a person, I still believe in abortion because I believe in every person’s right to control her body."
